    <p> <h1 style="text-align: center; color: blue;"> 05 Important Advice from Naval Ravikant</h1></p>
    
    <h3> <mark> 1: Focus on Building Wealth, Not Money </mark></h3>
    <p>If you want to learn how to create wealth, you first have to understand the difference between wealth and money. To Ravikant, wealth is owning assets that grow over time without further inputs from you. Money, by contrast, is merely the means of distributing wealth and time. The equity you own in a growing landscaping company is wealth; the cash people pay you for mowing their lawn is money. According to Ravikant, it’s more important to focus on generating wealth than on generating money.</p>

    <h3><mark> 2: Develop Specific Knowledge</mark> </h3>
    <p> Ravikant believes that, to create products or attract money, you have to specialize in something. Specifically, you should develop specific knowledge (a deep understanding) of something technical or creative. Expertise in these areas is especially useful for developing products. </p>

    <h3><mark> 3: Generate Passive Income</mark></h3>
    <p> Ravikant argues that the key to achieving financial freedom is having passive income. This is income that earns money with minimal effort from you. According to Ravikant, the best way to earn this income is by owning assets: For example, selling an easily reproducible product—such as a popular album of original music—is a source of passive income. </p>

    <h3><mark>4: Build Long-Term Business Relationships </mark> </h3>
    <p> Good relationships are invaluable for building wealth because working with people is far more productive and efficient than going solo. For Ravikant, building relationships in business isn’t a matter of short-term networking: It’s a matter of identifying capable and ethical people and building long-term relationships with them. It’s far more effective to simply stick with competent ethical people and deepen your rapport with them than to seek out more people: In business relationships, quality is more important than quantity. </p>

    <h3><mark> 5: Be Patient </mark> </h3>
    <p> The above principles are critical to building wealth, but wealth creation doesn’t happen overnight: Be patient. Ravikant encourages you to simply stick to the practices of developing and leveraging your skills and cultivating deep, trusting relationships with good people. If you give it enough time, these things will pay off. 

        If your ideas for a product fail at first, just keep generating more ideas. If you make a mistake in judgment, own it and learn from it, then carry on. Stay focused on your specialization, stay attuned to up-and-coming companies, and stick to the work: Achieving wealth is worth it. </p>
